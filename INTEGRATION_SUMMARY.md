## ⚠️ Key Decisions Required

### 1. Integration Approach

**Option A: Fork OpenHands (Recommended)**
- Pros: Full control, deep customization, own your stack
- Cons: More work upfront (4-6 weeks), must maintain fork
- Cost: Development time
- **Verdict**: Recommended for long-term

**Option B: Use OpenHands API**
- Pros: Faster (2 weeks), less maintenance
- Cons: Less control, vendor dependency, API limits
- Cost: API fees
- **Verdict**: Good for MVP/POC

**Recommendation**: Start with Option B for POC, migrate to Option A for production

---

### 2. Deployment Strategy

**Option A: Gradual Rollout**
- Phase 1: Beta users only (10-20)
- Phase 2: New customers only
- Phase 3: Upgrade existing customers
- Timeline: 6 months
- Risk: Lower

**Option B: Big Bang Launch**
- All customers get AI features immediately
- Aggressive marketing campaign
- Timeline: 3 months
- Risk: Higher, but faster revenue

**Recommendation**: Option A (gradual) for Questro, Option B for PipeWarden

---

### 3. Pricing Strategy

**Option A: Premium Tier**
```
Basic: $99/mo (no AI)
AI Pro: $299/mo (AI features)
AI Enterprise: $999/mo (unlimited AI)

Strategy: Upsell existing customers to AI tier
Risk: Some customers stay on basic
Revenue: Predictable, lower
```

**Option B: AI-First**
```
All plans include AI, but with usage limits:
Starter: $299/mo (50 AI operations)
Business: $799/mo (500 operations)
Enterprise: $2,499/mo (unlimited)

Strategy: All customers get AI, pay based on usage
Risk: Higher costs if users consume more than expected
Revenue: Higher, but variable
```

**Recommendation**: Option B (AI-first) - positions you as AI-native, not AI-bolted-on
